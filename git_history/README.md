# Understanding Git History

 In this Assignment, we will explore the concepts of Git history, the log command, and commands for reverting, undoing, resetting, and rebasing changes.

## Git Log:
The `git log` command is used to view the history and commit log of a repository. Running `git log` in the terminal displays a list of commits in reverse chronological order, with the most recent commit appearing first.

## Git Revert:
The `git revert` command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit, effectively reverting the changes. This allows you to keep a clear history while undoing specific modifications.
